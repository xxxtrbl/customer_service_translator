# Customer service translator for a DSL
## Content
Make a DSL for customer service, create the syntax, implement parser and intepretor.
## Domain Specific Language
A Domain Specific Language (DSL) can provide a relatively simple grammar for customizing business processes in specific domains. This assignment requires defining a domain-specific scripting language capable of describing the automatic response logic of online customer service robots. (Robot customer service is an important technology for improving customer service efficiency and is widely used in complex information systems in fields such as banking, telecommunications, and commerce.) Additionally, design and implement an interpreter to execute this script, providing appropriate responses based on different user inputs according to the logic defined in the script.
